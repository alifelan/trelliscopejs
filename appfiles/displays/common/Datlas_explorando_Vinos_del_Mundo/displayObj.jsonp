It has weight, ripe, bold fruit and soft tannins and is ready to drink.","$10 for this very drinkable Cab? That's crazy. But Line 39 is exactly that, a concentrated, juicy and fruity Cab with plenty of classic Cab tannins that's an incredibly good value and probably pretty easy to find. Scoop it up when you find it, though note that two bottles were tasted here with some bottle variation.","). Earth, cola and leather aromas are good, however the fruit portion of the bouquet is a bit damp and roasted. The palate is hard and rugged, with driving cherry and plum flavors. Earthy and herbal on the finish.","). Rubiolo is a soft and lush Chianti Classico with ripe fruit aromas backed by easy leather and tobacco. The wine shows nice lines and supple spice.",". Recent vintages have left Bordeaux with an alcohol problem, as seen in this wine. The saving grace is the essential Cabernet Sauvignon structure and acidity that keeps the ripe Merlot in balance.","A big, sturdy auslese, nearly dry in style yet showing some botrytis and plenty of concentration. Hints of dried apricots and mushrooms lead the way, and there is some citrusy character, but this brooding wine is best served with cheeses or savory dishes.","“Cocina” means “the kitchen” in Spanish, and this blend of Malbec, Bonarda and Syrah is definitely a kitchen-sink type of wine. It's stout, a bit reduced and tinny at first, but with air it turns into a nice, simple chunkster with plump baked-fruit flavors and a soft but structured chocolaty finish. Drink now.","A 75-25 blend that showcases the exotic lychee and pear aromas of Gewürz, while the Riesling asserts itself on the finish in a rush of bracing lime-like acidity. A unique blend that offers plenty of food-pairing versatility.","A “layered” blend of five different varieties, this starts off a bit floral and lemony, then develops some earthier notes to go along with the modest citrus flavors. Finishes short. Sémillon (37%), Muscat (20.5%), Gewürztraminer (19.5%), Pinot Gris (19%) and Chardonnay (4%).","\"Chremisa,\" the ancient name of Krems, is commemorated in this wine that comes from Krems vineyards. It has tight, tangy apple-driven acidity, with a bright, light, citrusy character. Not for aging."]},"description_count_min":{"name":"description_count_min","desc":"description_count_min","type":"numeric","group":"description","defLabel":false,"defActive":true,"filterable":false,"log":null,"range":[1,1],"nnna":10,"breaks":[0,1],"delta":1},"description_count_mean":{"name":"description_count_mean","desc":"description_count_mean","type":"numeric","group":"description","defLabel":false,"defActive":true,"filterable":true,"log":null,"range":[1.0576,1.1041],"nnna":10,"breaks":[1.05,1.06,1.07,1.08,1.09,1.1,1.11],"delta":0.01},"description_count_max":{"name":"description_count_max","desc":"description_count_max","type":"numeric","group":"description","defLabel":false,"defActive":true,"filterable":true,"log":null,"range":[2,3],"nnna":10,"breaks":[2,2.2,2.4,2.6,2.8,3],"delta":0.2},"description_max_name":{"name":"description_max_name","desc":"description_max_name","type":"factor","group":"description","defLabel":false,"defActive":true,"filterable":true,"log":null,"levels":["Wood flavors dominate this young wine. It has structure and tannins, with concentrated toast and chocolate flavors. The extraction of the fruit gives the wine a bitter character. It should soften, so drink from 2019.","Seductively tart in lemon pith, cranberry and pomegranate, this refreshing, light-bodied quaff is infinitely enjoyable, both on its own or at the table. It continues to expand on the palate into an increasing array of fresh flavors, finishing in cherry and orange.","Yeasty, toasty aromas come with notes of brown sugar and baking spices. Lively and good on the palate, this tastes of dry citrus fruits and nectarine. A fresh-feeling, citrusy finish is clean and firm.","This zesty red has pretty aromas that suggest small red berry, blue flower and a whiff of moist soil. The vibrant palate offers sour cherry, pomegranate and a hint of anise alongside zesty acidity and refined tannins.","Young, herbaceous wine, very fruity and lightly perfumed. It is crisp and delicate, with its citrus and pineapple fruits already lively and fresh.","Zesty lime pith and lemon notes abound in this lively off-dry Riesling. It's feather-light in body yet radiant, offering loads of pristine tangerine and apricot flavors. It's juicy and approachable yet effortlessly elegant. A widely appealing sip to enjoy from now to 2021.","Stalky aromas suggest hay and green herbs, with raspberry in the backdrop. It's hot and short in terms of mouthfeel, with herbal flavors leading the way and berry fruit running behind. Dry red fruit and herbal notes dominate the finish.","Woodsy earthy berry aromas share the nose with fresh-cut oak scents. This Carmenère-Syrah blend feels lively and juicy, not heavy or flat. Dark spicy berry and plum flavors include notes of olive and oak, while the finish is spicy and tastes of olive and tobacco.","Young Hunter Valley Sémillon is one of the most perplexing wines to evaluate, and I suspect that in 8–10 years' time, my rating will seem overly stingy. Still, this light-bodied wine appears to lack depth, complexity and length, offering just some odd, resiny scents and waxy, citrusy flavors.","Zweigelt can do easy-drinking styles but in the right hands, it can also turn into something more elegant. That's the case here: This exudes sophistication. Subtle use of oak supports the supple structure and gives the ripe red cherry fruit a more velvety spin. While this is ready now, it may well get even better with a year or two in bottle."]},"designation_min_name":{"name":"designation_min_name","desc":"designation_min_name","type":"factor","group":"designation","defLabel":false,"defActive":true,"filterable":true,"log":null,"levels":["10-Years-Old

But Line 39 is exactly that, a concentrated, juicy and fruity Cab with plenty of classic Cab tannins that's an incredibly good value and probably pretty easy to find. Scoop it up when you find it, though note that two bottles were tasted here with some bottle variation.":1,"). Earth, cola and leather aromas are good, however the fruit portion of the bouquet is a bit damp and roasted. The palate is hard and rugged, with driving cherry and plum flavors. Earthy and herbal on the finish.":1,"). Rubiolo is a soft and lush Chianti Classico with ripe fruit aromas backed by easy leather and tobacco. The wine shows nice lines and supple spice.":1,". Recent vintages have left Bordeaux with an alcohol problem, as seen in this wine. The saving grace is the essential Cabernet Sauvignon structure and acidity that keeps the ripe Merlot in balance.":1,"“Cocina” means “the kitchen” in Spanish, and this blend of Malbec, Bonarda and Syrah is definitely a kitchen-sink type of wine. It's stout, a bit reduced and tinny at first, but with air it turns into a nice, simple chunkster with plump baked-fruit flavors and a soft but structured chocolaty finish. Drink now.":1,"15% Alicante Bouschet gives this wine its dark color and rich, plummy texture. It has weight, ripe, bold fruit and soft tannins and is ready to drink.":1,"A “layered” blend of five different varieties, this starts off a bit floral and lemony, then develops some earthier notes to go along with the modest citrus flavors. Finishes short. Sémillon (37%), Muscat (20.5%), Gewürztraminer (19.5%), Pinot Gris (19%) and Chardonnay (4%).":1,"A 75-25 blend that showcases the exotic lychee and pear aromas of Gewürz, while the Riesling asserts itself on the finish in a rush of bracing lime-like acidity. A unique blend that offers plenty of food-pairing versatility.":1,"A big, sturdy auslese, nearly dry in style yet showing some botrytis and plenty of concentration.

The vibrant palate offers sour cherry, pomegranate and a hint of anise alongside zesty acidity and refined tannins.":1,"Wood flavors dominate this young wine. It has structure and tannins, with concentrated toast and chocolate flavors. The extraction of the fruit gives the wine a bitter character.

Lively and good on the palate, this tastes of dry citrus fruits and nectarine. A fresh-feeling, citrusy finish is clean and firm.":1,"Young Hunter Valley Sémillon is one of the most perplexing wines to evaluate, and I suspect that in 8–10 years' time, my rating will seem overly stingy. Still, this light-bodied wine appears to lack depth, complexity and length, offering just some odd, resiny scents and waxy, citrusy flavors.":1,"Young, herbaceous wine, very fruity and lightly perfumed. It is crisp and delicate, with its citrus and pineapple fruits already lively and fresh.":1,"Zesty lime pith and lemon notes abound in this lively off-dry Riesling. It's feather-light in body yet radiant, offering loads of pristine tangerine and apricot flavors. It's juicy and approachable yet effortlessly elegant. A widely appealing sip to enjoy from now to 2021.":1,"Zweigelt can do easy-drinking styles but in the right hands, it can also turn into something more elegant.
